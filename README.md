# Lossless Image Compressor

Small Python project that demonstrates a simple lossless image compressor using BMP images for testing.

## Files
- `LosslessCompressor.py` — main script in this folder.
- Several `.bmp` sample images used for testing.

## Usage
Run the compressor with Python 3:

```
python LosslessCompressor.py
```

## Notes
- This repository currently contains sample images and the compressor script.
- Add a `.gitignore` if you want to exclude large image files from the repo.

Feel free to ask me to add a `.gitignore`, license, or more documentation.
